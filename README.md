# Ready-Set-Code-

## Overview
Welcome to the Ready-Set-Code programming competition! This repository serves as the central submission platform for participants to submit their solutions to various programming challenges.

## Competition Structure

This competition features a diverse collection of programming problems implemented in **C++** or **Java**, categorized by difficulty levels:
- **Easy**: Fundamental programming concepts and basic algorithms
- **Medium**: Intermediate problem-solving requiring solid understanding of data structures
- **Hard**: Advanced challenges demanding complex algorithmic thinking and optimization

## Repository Organization

The repository is organized into **5 groups**, each containing problems of varying difficulty:

```

```

## How to Submit Your Solutions

1. **Navigate** to the appropriate group folder (group 1-5)
2. **Select** the difficulty level folder (easy, medium, or hard)
3. **Submit** your solution file with a descriptive name
4. **Format**: Use `.cpp` for C++ solutions or `.java` for Java solutions
5. **Naming Convention**: `problemName_yourName.cpp` or `problemName_yourName.java`

## Submission Guidelines

- Each solution should be a complete, standalone program
- Include comments in your code to explain your approach
- Ensure your code compiles without errors
- Test your solution thoroughly before submission
- Only submit code in C++ or Java programming languages

## Evaluation Criteria

Solutions will be evaluated based on:
- **Correctness**: Does the solution solve the problem accurately?
- **Efficiency**: How optimal is the algorithm in terms of time and space complexity?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured, readable, and properly commented?
- **Best Practices**: Does the code follow language-specific conventions and standards?

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Choose a problem from any group and difficulty level
3. Write your solution in C++ or Java
4. Submit your code to the appropriate folder
5. Wait for evaluation and feedback
